GeoGuessr web map guide with Google Street View API

This primarily JavaScript file demonstrates a few interesting things. It relies on leaflet.js, leaflet-google.js, Turf.js, and Google Maps API. I demonstrate how to include the "pegman" tool to see Street View imagery at any chosen location in a Leaflet map. I also demonstrate how to include Street View imagery for chosen point data using iframes. 

I combined boolean geospatial intersection queries with Turf.js with the Leaflet popup feature and Leaflet layer control panel to create a dynamic and user-friendly layer selection tool. I also fixed the popup issue within Leaflet in which the popup gets shifted over after the width gets increased.
